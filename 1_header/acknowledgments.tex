I would like to thank my supervisor, Jingbo Wang. Your support and guidance throughout the course of my studies has made this journey immensely rewarding. Thank you for pulling together an incredible team of like-minded students and mentors, and for your excellent management of the QUISA research group and the quantum optimisation subgroup. In taking on the role of connecting people together in meaningful pursuits of knowledge, you have created an community of collaborators which extends well beyond the usual barrier of academics and researchers into the real world. It is only through collaborations of this kind that science can impact society.

I also extend my thanks to Tavis, Edric, Pascal, Aidan, Andrew, and Leo for their support on the project. Tavis for sharing his valuable research, which made this whole project possible. Edric for the many insights in data analysis and QuOp. Pascal for the top-down view of the project as a quantum-HPC hybrid expert. Aiden, Andrew, and Leo, for the feedback, collaboration which guided the analysis and generation of these results.

Thank you to Benjamin Rossdeutscher. Our academic journeys have been in parallel for many years, and your personal and professional support have been a key part of not just this thesis but the path here.

Finally, I thank my family and friends for their continuous support throughout my degree. Without you, none of this would have been possible.
